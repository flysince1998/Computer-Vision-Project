Hand Detection Tester

This repository contains testing files and scripts dedicated to evaluating the accuracy and functionality of the hand detection module developed for an interactive color picker project. The core of the hand detection utilizes the MediaPipe library, which enables the tracking of hand landmarks and the identification of pointing gestures. The provided testing code allows users to assess the system's performance in detecting pointing gestures and accurately reporting finger positions. The testing scripts include cases for general pointing detection as well as more advanced scenarios, such as pointing at a specific target. These files serve as a crucial component in the development and refinement of the hand tracking capabilities before integration into the larger interactive color picker application.
